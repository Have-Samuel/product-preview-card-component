}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for responsivess and media queries.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma is an amazing, it helped me finally understand the whole design frame. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
